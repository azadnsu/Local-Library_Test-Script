# This is a test assignment to automate two test cases in https://raamatukogu.herokuapp.com:
    1. Add new book to catalogue https://raamatukogu.herokuapp.com/catalog/book/create
    2. Verify newly added book is listed in catalogue https://raamatukogu.herokuapp.com/catalog/books
    
I have not implemented Waits because of less time. I could be able to improve by 
implmenting explicit waits. Also, test cases could be separate classes. I could use reports generator but thats also skipping now.
If I get more time I can add all these. However, I am submitting it by fulfilling basic requirements.
